In addition to the exhaust cover which should be printed in ABS, there are 3 TPU parts included:
* For 4.5mm cables like the ones shipped with BTT SB2209 boards
* For 5.6mm cables like the ones shipped with some later versions of the BTT SB2240 boards
* Blanks (no holes) to cover the unused spots in the exhaust cover

For added strain relief, bend a 1.20mm metal wire under the TPU parts like so:
